* Avon, Zacharias, Penfold, Tessa.

* Childhood friends, game possibly taking place during their teenager years.

* Something draws them together and they find out their lives are intertwined.

* Each level is a decent into their memories, trying to unlock memories and hidden knowledge.

* Something has wiped memory and trying to prevent them from finding out the knowledge. (The truth)

* Levels could be styled differently depending on what character the player has chosen.

* During the game and when playing, whichever character the player has chosen encounters the other characters in the 'dungeon'.

* Dice (?) - Would be cool to use the literal concept of dice to play into the lore of the world and 'dungeons'. Characters use dice as weapons or mechanic in game?
 
* Perma-death and single-play-through gameplay, but more some stuff is persistent and needs to be unlocked / rewarded as played.
